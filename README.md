# Dotfiles

Here I'll place my dotfiles for my setup in a machine with EndeavourOS and i3wm as window manager (I'm in love with tiling window managers, and this one was not that bad to work with an NVIDIA GPU).

This config isn't ready yet, since I just configured neovim to work with Golang. I'll add support for other programing languages such as Python, Typescript, Rust and C.

I'm so tired today, so just wanted to backup this stuff...

Later I'll add dependencies and everything else.
