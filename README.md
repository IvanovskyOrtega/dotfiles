# Dotfiles

Here I'll place my dotfiles for my setup for whatever distro I'll use. 

By now I'm using Arch Linux with Gnome, the `setup.sh` script will use `pacman` and `yay` to install stuff.

I got tired of i3 since wanted to learn to use my split keyboard, nvim and tmux. I was overwhelmed of so many commands to learn and first I got used to type in the Corne Keyboard, the move to nvim and finally I'm learning tmux. I'm not that productive yet as I am with Codium and Tilix/iTerm, but hopefully I will.

Maybe someday I'll go back to i3wm once I master tmux and neovim and became a terminal God (xd).
